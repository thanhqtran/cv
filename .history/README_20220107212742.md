## Template

The original file was obtained from a git by [Mohammad Abdullah Al Mamun
](https://github.com/Mamunia/cv) in order to update publications from your own .bib file.

I combined it with some features from [Paciorek](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~paciorek/computingTips/Latex_template_creating_CV_.html)'s res template.

Feel free to use and modify it yourself.
