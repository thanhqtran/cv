# Curriculum Vitae

This is the LaTeX source code for my current CV.

Modified from: [https://github.com/ptsgmartins/cv-LaTeX-template](https://github.com/ptsgmartins/cv-LaTeX-template)

Pros:
- minimalistic. no extra `.sty`, `.res` or `.cls` files needed.
- the documentclass is `article`, simple edit and compile.
- beautifully formatted.

The workflow automatically compiles the `.tex` file upon changes and generates a `.pdf` file that you can use to host your CV.

To enable embedded view without the need to download the file, attach this `url`:

`https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=[path to pdf on git]`

To obtain the correct path, go to the GitHub page that stores the pdf and simply copy the URL on the address bar of your browser.

A PDF file is automatically generated by [github.workflow](https://github.com/xu-cheng/latex-action) and can be viewed in html [guide](https://kekayan.medium.com/display-your-resume-cv-pdf-in-website-using-github-73a088ac961d).
